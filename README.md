# Pygame Tetris

This is a simple Tetris clone developed in Python using the Pygame library.

### Functionality

The Tetris clone provides a classic Tetris gaming experience with the following features:

* Tetromino movement (left, right, speed up fall, drop)
* Tetromino rotation
* Line clearing and scoring
* Pausing
* Game over detection

## Dependencies

To run the Tetris clone, you need to have Python installed on your system, and you'll also need the Pygame library. Install the required dependencies using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to Start

To start the Tetris clone, run the following command in your terminal:

`python Game/main.py`

This will launch the game, and you can use the arrow keys for movement (**Left**, **Right**, **Down**), the **Up** key to rotate the Tetrominos, and **Spacebar** for droping the Tetromino. For pausing and unpausing you can use the **Escape** key.
